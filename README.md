## General Info
I am a data visualization developer at Yahoo Finance! I will be helping the "Netflix Stock Profile" team visualize the Netflix stock data for the year 2017. In finance, a _stock profile_ is a series of studies, visualizations, and analyses that dive into different aspects of a publicly traded company's data. During this project, I analyze, prepare, and plot data. These visualizations will help the financial analysts asses the risk of the Netflix stock.
## Technologies
+ Python
+ Matplotlib
+ Pandas
+ Seaborn
+ Jupyter Notebook
## Features
The project visualizes the following:
+ The distribution of the stock prices for the year 2017
+ Netflix's earnings and revenue in all four quarters
+ The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017
+ A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017
Note: We are using the Dow Jones Industrial Average to compare the Netflix stock to the larger stock market.
